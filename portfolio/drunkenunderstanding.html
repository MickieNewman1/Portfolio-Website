                    Drunken Understandig
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                    A beige minivan pulled up to the street corner and let two people out in front of a two-story house. They both waved to the van as it pulled away. The house was extraordinarily beautiful in the fall. The trees outside slowly shed their leaves like confetti; vibrant reds, yellows and oranges showered passersby like the trees’ final celebration before their death in winter. There was a small wooden staircase on the outside of the building was covered in ivy giving it a fairy tale feel. It led to the upstairs apartment. Inside the walls were painted vibrant colors, papers and knickknacks lined all surfaces that weren’t the floor, and art supplies were scattered all across the living room. Inside the kitchen there was a mountain of unwashed dishes. The walls were lined with paintings of varying quality and abstractness all signed Sylvia O’Connor. Any free space left was occupied by pictures, most of them had a woman with hair the color of rubies and a man with curly black hair.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The couple walked up to the house and stumbled up the stairs; the smell of liquor infected the clouds that they exhaled into the cold night air. The crimson-haired woman tripped on one of the steps and the man caught her. They both laughed as they got to the door and fumbled with the keys. Once inside the man turned on the television and flopped on the couch. The woman went into the bathroom and splashed water into her face from the sink
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think I’ve had a little too much tonight.” Sylvia said as she filled a glass with water and walked into the living room. “Hey, what did you think of Tina’s date? He seemed a bit awkward to me.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He seemed fine to me just nervous about first impressions that’s all.” He replied shutting his eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m just saying he’s definitely more into her than she’s into him.” Sylvia laid down on the couch putting her feet over his lap.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why are we talking about who Tina brought to the party? He seemed like a normal dude. It’s not any of our business.” He said and then laid his head back on the couch.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well of course it’s my business Tina’s my friend. We don’t know anything about him he could be a murderer, or like a sex trafficker. Tomorrow we could wake up and Tina will be hog tied on a van headed for Peru.” Sylvia said while yawning and pushing her head into a pillow. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Awe yeah, and that won’t happen now that we are gossiping about him.” He said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sylvia turned her head to look at him, “Exactly”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their drunken laughter filled the room with warmth which lingered even after it died down. They remained in utter silence as the tv’s light danced across the room making the once colorful walls look like subtle shades of black and grey. Sylvia slowly slinked up to a sitting position, “Hey, Steve, wake up,” She said as she poked him in the cheek. “I’ve got to tell you something.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m listening” Steve remined in the same position eyes still closed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok, just promise me you won’t be mad.” She said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve opened his eyes and turned to look at her, “Well, that makes me a little nervous but go ahead.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She looked down at her hands as she fiddled with her bracelet, “So last weekend at that party I got drunk with this girl Amy and one thig lead to another and we ended up making out.” Sylvia shrugged and raised her eyebrows and looked at Steve for a reaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok?” He said as he squinted his eyes unsure of what to say next. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I was drunk, and I only kissed her it meant nothing. I just wanted to tell you so there weren’t any secrets between us.” She said trying desperately to sound casual. She grabbed his hand for reassurance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve instantly relaxed, “Ok, so you made out with some girl at a party, no big deal. It wasn’t like it was a guy or anything.” Steve once again shut his eyes and leaned back. Sylvia relieved about the outcome let the silence linger as she squeezed his hand. As she thought over the conversation a new thought crept over her and she dropped his hand. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Wait so if it was a guy you would have broken up with me?” She slid to a position where she could face him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve, sensing the shift in her voice, sat up once again and considered his response carefully, “No, I would have been mad, but I wouldn’t have broken it off completely.” He said pausing after every phrase.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok,” Sylvia said taking a deep breath clearly contemplating what he had said. She tried desperately to sound normal and straightforward. “I don’t understand why there’s a difference. My last relationship was with a woman and it lasted two years.” She laughed a little to try and lighten the mood but her eyes were locked on him like lasers as she tried desperately to dig into his thoughts. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I guess I just don’t see you in that way.” He answered honestly as he met her piercing gaze. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She crossed her arms and furrowed her eyebrow, “Just because you can’t see that part doesn’t mean that it’s not there.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I feel like you’re mad.” Steve said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m not.” Sylvia said looking away from him as she plaid with her bracelet again. “I just find it interesting, that’s all.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What do you find interesting about this?” Steve asked sensing that something was bothering her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t know,” Sylvia said as she tried to gather her thoughts. “Either you can’t understand my sexuality, or you don’t see women as a threat to you in the same way as a man… Either way I guess I’m mad?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve laughed and put his arm around her. “You literally told me not to be mad. I think you are reading too much into this.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sylvia seeing her ridiculousness smiled and leaned into him. “Well now that you’ve explained it, I’m mad that you aren’t mad.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok so I guess I’m mad at you.” Steve replied as he kissed her on the neck and hugged her tightly. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sylvia rolled her eyes and pushed him away smirking. “But the thing is you don’t mean that. You aren’t actually mad you are just saying that.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This is the most ridiculous conversation we have ever had.” Steve replied as he laid on top of her playfully. He started tickled her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “AAAHH, Stop.” she exclaimed in between bouts of laughter. He stopped and pinned her down without a struggle and kissed her. The smell of peppermint schnapps entered her nostrils bringing back the memories of the party that night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sylvia looked up at him and smiled. “I just don’t like when how you see me and who I really am are so different.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well then, I’m absolutely furious with you.” Steve kissed her sloppily on the cheek and they both start to laugh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Shut the fuck up.” Sylvia said as she finally kissed him back. 
                </p>
