                    Eight more hours, that’s all I have to do, survive for eight more hours and then I’m done. The first period on the last day of senior year time was like sandpaper, every second I sat still wore me down just a little bit as it passed by. An hour of leg bouncing and turning back to look at the clock passed, as Ms. Spencer gave a half-hearted lecture on Macbeth. Then finally, “Class dismissed, have a good life.” Having almost ended her first and last year at this school, Ms. Spencer looked exhausted as the flock of seniors rushed out of her class.

                    There were only about 150 kids in the entire high school. It’s the sort of place where everyone knew everyone without actually knowing them. There were many names and faces I knew well through legendary feats and sensationalized gossip. Big things were constantly buzzing around the school like how Ally Hall slept with the chemistry teacher and that’s why he was fired and how Kevin Rivera went to rehab last summer. There were also little things like Misha and Adam are dating now, Cody Calapolo got the choir solo, or William Cloutis was just the weirdest dude. Even though I’ve never spoken a word to these people in the four years I’ve been there, I knew so much about their lives. In a place where everyone knows everything about everybody, I relished in my invisibility. Despite the small pockets of teenage rebellion most of our school was very conservative and very judgmental. So no skirts shorter than the knee, no makeup, and for the love of god absolutely no shoulders. . It functioned like what I thought prison would be like. When I first got there, I walked on a tightrope unsure of what was acceptable or not. As I assimilated into this society, I learned which rules were brittle and which rules could bend. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thank god for second period study hall and Mr. Washington’s incompetence. All I needed to do was ask to go to the bathroom, and then I was free to do whatever I want for the rest of the period. The best part was that my best friend Alizabeth had the same study hall. When I entered the classroom, her dark brown eyes locked onto mine, and within that moment we had made a plan. There was no homework to be done, no projects due, or tests to study for. So there was only one thing to do sneak out of class and go to the library one last time. I walked up to Mr. Washington’s desk and asked, “May Alizabeth and I”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yep,” he interrupted not even looking up from the paper he was grading. He knew the routine by now and no longer cared.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I looked over to Alizabeth and nodded. I then grabbed a handful of her binders and textbooks as we walked out of the room. There had always been a sort of nonverbal agreement between us that I would carry half of her stuff. Alizabeth didn’t believe in lockers, mainly her locker. Since freshman year she would lug seven binders and five textbooks to every class she had. Up two flights of stairs, outside, or into another building, all her stuff was always with her.  At first it drove me crazy. Why would any person subject themselves to that kind of torture? As I got to know her, I realized that without this system she would always forget something. So, I gave in and now I helped her carry things between classes.
             </p>
             <p>
                As we exited the room, we had to decide which route to the library to take. There were two possible options. One was the most direct route, the other required going down the back stairs, walking across the downstairs hallway and going up the main stairs. At that point there were still a few kids in the hallway rushing to their next class, but the teachers lined each side of the hallway holding open their doors ready to close them when class started. We looked down the hall towards the library and saw Mrs. Deeds standing outside her room. Mrs. Deeds was the official mom of the high school. She will dress code anyone within a ten-foot radius and cannot stand any talking or disorder in her class but is the first person to go to when some girl was crying in the bathroom. Fun fact every winter as a Christmas present, she would knit all her math students either a scarf or hat, two items coincidentally prohibited by the dress code. I had received three hats during my time at that school and she hemmed my prom dress for free. I loved Mrs. Deeds, but today I was wearing a slightly lower cut top. I knew she would send me to the office on my last day of school to change and give me the ‘I’m disappointed with you’ look.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Let’s go the long way.” I told her, as we turned away heading for the staircase. We pattered along at a brisk pace and I watched Alizabeth’s curly black hair bounce as we went down the corridor. I always thought she was beautiful. She was slightly taller and a lot curvier than I was. Her soft features were complemented by her dark skin and light brown eyes. Her smile was both constant and infectious, she made friends with just about everyone she met.
            </p>
            <p>
             We passed and occasionally talked to all the different teachers. There were the ex-military teachers Mr. Heopner, Mr. Regal, and Ms. Grey. They were strict during class (stay silent, look forward, do ten pushups if you throw a wadded paper into the trash can and it misses, etc.), but were your best friends outside of class. And finally, there were the new teachers, they really did not care what we did because they were just trying to get to the end of the day.  We rounded the corner of the downstairs hallway thinking we were home free. Then Ms. Stevens walked out of the front office and headed straight for us.
         </p>
         <p>
            If Mrs. Deeds was the mother of the school, Ms. Stevens was the evil stepmother. She relishes in making herself feel powerful and important by making her students feel stupid, but she will look the other way for a few select students who boosted her ego. Lucky for us, Alizabeth was one of those students and I was small enough to slip by unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh, Ms. Stevens how’s your book coming along?” Alizabeth said as she approached her. Ms. Steven’s face lit up and she did her typical talking points. I started walking ahead unnoticed as Alizabeth talked to her. Noticing she would be late; Ms. Stevens quickly ended the conversation and ran off to her classroom. I waited for Alizabeth in the doorway of the library. When she finally caught up, we opened up the double doors and stepped into the library.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were  certain aspects of the school library that always hit me right as I entered. The bare white walls, the strange multicolored carpet, and that trademark scent of flowery air freshener trying and failing to hide the faint hints of tuna fish and mildew all contributed to the grey gloom that hung over the library. Despite this there was a homely warmth shining through the surface aesthetics making it my favorite place in the school. Alizabeth and I spent most of our free time there. We often helped Kathrine, the librarian, do inventory on textbooks. Most days we ate lunch and played cards with her. Sometimes, if I forget my lunch, she would split her tuna sandwich with me. She usually turns a blind eye to our bullshit.
        </p>
        <p>
            I walked in a little behind Alizabeth and notice that the library was pretty busy. Kathrine was busy trying to help middle schoolers find books for some project. We headed toward the back of the library and settled ourselves next to a smallest fish tank on the back wall. I hunched over the back shelf and peered into the tank. A bright blue beta fish stared right back at me.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Anything new with him?” Alizabeth asked. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “You can tell there is murder in his eyes.” I said, “I know Sushi hates me.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sushi was the name of our library fish. Kathrine had moved him over to this corner because that’s where we went when the library is busy.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ok first of all, he is a fish, he hates everybody. Don’t act like you’re anything special.” She said smiling. “Second of all, Sushi is our son, so you have to love him even if he secretly wants to cut your head off.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sushi came into our lives junior year of high school. He was originally a fish with no name until the librarian had a naming contest for him. Alizabeth and I submitted the name Sushi as a joke, but it turned out no one else bothered to submit any other name, so he was named Sushi by default. And for the rest of high school our inside joke was that Sushi was our illegitimate bastard child. A few days ago, Kathrine had put him in another tank with two other fish (Sherlock and Watson) overnight, so she could clean out his tank. In the morning both of the other fish were dead. Within a single night the number of library fish went from three to one.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I don’t know if love is an option anymore. I’m thinking of disowning him. I’m not liking his attitude.”
        </p>
        <p>
            Sushi blobbed his way blindly around the tank slowly swimming to one end … and then the other.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Maybe he is just depressed, you ever think of that? I mean, I would be if I were him floating around in a small tank all alone.” She said. I backed away from the tank and took a seat on the floor next to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I think all fish are depressed.” I replied mockingly. “Well, this is probably the last time we’ll see him anyway, so I might as well end it on good terms. I won’t disown him”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Oh my god. It’s our last day with our son.” she said. She then looked right at me and said, “Fuck! Mickie, it’s our last day here”  
        </p>
        <p>
            “How do you feel about it ending?” I asked, not even sure of my emotions hoping that her perspective could have made mine clearer.
        </p>
        <p>
            “I honestly don’t know. I’m relieved it’s all over. I’ll be able to get out of here, but I’m scared of what comes next. You know? I don’t even know if I want to go to college. I mean, I got into UCCS so I guess that’s what I should do… but I just don’t know it’s the right choice. What about you?” She took my hand and smirked at me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I thought long and hard about my answer, “Well, I’m definitely going to miss certain things, mainly the people.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            With that Alizabeth started to giggle. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “What? I can be anti-social and still miss certain people” I interjected, trying to defend myself, “You know what I mean, not everyone but like you and Kathrine. I won’t be able to see you guys every day and that’s weird and sad and scary. At the same time, I don’t know how I’ll feel because it hasn’t happened yet. I’m just anticipating the pain while trying to get to the end. But I do agree I’m ready to get out of here.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Yeah I get that” she said.
        </p>
        <p>
            “We should just leave” I said.
        </p>
        <p>
            “Wait, what?” 
        </p>
        <p>
            “After lunch we should just go” I said, “Oh come on, no one will notice. We are two of the ten seniors who didn’t skip class today. It’s almost expected that we leave early.”
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ok, I’m down as long as you’re driving.” She replied. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “Ok, let’s do this” I said.
        </p>
