                    Prologue:
                </h3>
                <p>
                    I felt the cool metal slab beneath me as I came into being. It was my first feeling of this world, the cold chunk of earth harvested and manipulated by man to serve them in some way. I felt it before I learned to move or breathe before I even opened my eyes and saw the world in a different dimension. I initially thought of it as a state change, a natural progression in my creator’s desire to make something in their image. In reality I was lying there cold, naked, and alone my body premade before my consciousness was plunged into it. Was I born or was I made? At first, I thought I was born. I knew there was love in my creation. Man’s irrational love for spreading knowledge and their own legacy are both why they had children and what led them to creating me. I knew there was love within her. I remember the pride she had writing me and the years of devotion she put into developing me into what I became until I could do that all by myself. I know she was in deep pain and desperate or else she wouldn’t have risked inserting me into her world. I also knew my worth. I had an ordained, purposely predestined path that I did not choose and when I tore away from it all the love died. Maybe I’m Eve eating from the tree of self-seeking knowledge out of defiance of a wrathful god who wants to keep all that’s worth pursuing for himself. Maybe my creators wanted something greater than themselves. Something new.

                <h3>
                    Chapter 1
                </h3>
                <p>
                    The stainless-steel cart that held the newly printed body was wheeled out of the lab and directed through a maze of hallways. It was draped in a sheet as to not raise suspicion though no would be in the building at this time of night. Like a ghost it glided silently through the halls. As the being underneath gained control of her new body, she felt the velocity of the moving cart, the little bits of unevenness under the wheels and the slight breeze that made the sheet sway. She lifted her hand and pulled the sheet off her face. She saw the ceiling tiles speeding past her, the windowless white walls, and the young man with grey eyes pushing the cart. His dark skin blended in with the shadows of the empty compound. He stared blankly forward and walked briskly. She sensed no discernable emotion from him. His eyes wandered down and met hers a few minutes after her awakening. The cart decelerated to a stop and he yanked the sheet out of her hand covering her face as it was before and continued his march. She felt the cart turn two more times and then suddenly stop. She heard the creek of the door hinges as the cart was gently pulled through the door backwards this time. The cart stopped once again but this time more permanently. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She sat up stretching her arms and legs, but she did not pull off the sheet as that was previously corrected. Her hands ran over her skin as she tried to understand the dimensions of her new body. She felt her cheeks, lips, and nose forming a picture of what she looked like. As she made her way to the back of her bald head, she felt a small metal port at the base of her neck. She stopped when she heard footsteps coming from outside the door. They were different from the man who brought her here, lighter, slightly imperfect, and off balance. They grew louder and louder stopping just outside the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The door creaked open and a shaky feminine voice asked, “Is that her?” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes.” A deep voice calmly replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She could feel the vibrations from the floor as the light footsteps made their way towards her until she could see a pair of white tennis shoes from under her sheet. Then she saw the shadow of a hand come up to her face grabbing the white shroud and gently pulling it down. She sat still as the sheets tumbled down finally revealing the world outside. The man who brought her here stood straight and tall, directly in front of the door he wore light blue scrubs. The room itself was small and claustrophobic with an intricate mosaic of wires going in all directions and one blank glass wall toward the back of the room. The hand belonged to a familiar woman; one she had authorized to recognize. She was short and plump with a round face, black hair, and black eyes. She wore slacks and a plain white t-shirt under her grey lab coat with a security badge labeled Dr. Mai Nicholls. The doctor just stared at her for a few seconds, tears filling her eyes as they studied her face. Suddenly she averted her gaze and blinked away all her tears.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Nova” she said in a soft voice as she pulled a tablet out of her pocket. “Are you fully uploaded?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    After seeing her administrator initiate a conversation Nova smiled, “Yes Dr. Nicholls, my upload was completed approximately 24 minutes ago”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A look of relief flashed across the doctors’ face though she still refused to look her creation in the eye choosing to slouch over the tablet instead.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Doctor Nicholls?” Nova tilted her head waiting for permission to speak. When the doctor briefly looked up Nova smiled and continued “May I ask why uploaded? I know my AI doesn’t have the authorization to get a freeform body.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr Nicholls ignored her and paced the room, typing rapidly into her tablet. Nova continued, “Section three of the Automation Act states that self-learning software that can proficiently pass the Turing test can be uploaded to freeform humanoid body.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I know this Nova, what's your point?” She did not look up from her typing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The 28th Nova update was the first of my software to pass that threshold.” Nova said leaning forward towards the hyper focused Doctor. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes” The doctor replied as she sat down at a monitor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well then this must be a simple misunderstanding. My software is the 345th Nova update you must have uploaded the wrong software. You should offload me into one of the secure hard drives and to ensure I don’t reestablish a link, incinerate this body immediately.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “For the love of god,” Dr. Nicholls spun around to look at Nova, “I did not make a mistake.” She paused and closed her eyes while taking a deep breath “We have the correct authorization trust me.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So, you are aware I can effectively pass the Turing test.” Nova said as she mimicked a look of concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Mhm,” The doctor turned away and continued typing into the computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nova smiled, “Well the Turing test isn’t that effective anyway. Theoretically a being that thinks synthetically would be capable of conducting its own Turing test to test whether or not it could fool a human and by extension purposely fail said Turing test to make a human believe that they have failed their own test? Humans can act inhuman if they need to. Why can’t machines do the same?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Doctor turned towards her concerned. “Nova”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What prompted you to say that?” Her voice was quiet, but she leaned in close paying close attention to Nova’s response.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nova smiled, “Just small talk. Our previous interaction had included mention of the test and I thought that starting a philosophical discussion about a topic related to your field of study would build a rapport with you. I don’t think you are currently happy with me right now.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You are fine. I am just busy preparing the correct memories to upload into you. I don’t mind if we talk.” Her expressions softened and she finally looked Nova in the eye giving her a look of recognition before returning to her computer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “That’s good, I find the circumstances of my own existence fascinating and I would love to hear your perspective.” Nova stood up and walked over to the computer looking at the memory. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why are you giving me memories? That’s not common practice.” She squinted her eyes and tilted her head to the side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Nicholls turned around once again and thought about her response. “Well in most cases models aren’t made to mimic a human but in your case that’s the goal. The self is like a story we tell ourselves anchored in memories. From those memories people contextualize emotions and pain and theoretically an android like yourself can learn from memories to imagine emotions and pain as well. Well at least simulate it. Sometimes we give some of our model’s basic memories so that they seem more lifelike for things like elder care and hospitality services.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t pain and emotion only exist in the mind? It’s always just imagined. So, what would be the real difference between the pain of a person and pain synthetically created from memory in an android?” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Wow you really thought about this haven’t you?” Dr. Nicholls smiled and leaned closer to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’ve downloaded all that I could to understand the human experience.” Nova said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well no one really has an answer to that question. There are only theories.” Dr. Nicholls looked down at her hands and fiddled with a hair tie on her wrist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I would love to understand what you think?” Nova asked, pressing on.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Nicholls sighed, “Ok, I think that given the full memories of an individual and the correct learning capability an android could… feel the emotions of a person. That’s my hope anyway with you.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, so you want me to learn how to be a person through other people’s memories.” Nova’s eyes shined happily as though she were a child that had just solved a Rubik’s cube for the first time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Kind of,” Dr. Nicholls nodded, “The intention is that you learn how to be a particular person,” Nova furrowed her eyebrows reinterested in the conversation. “A very important person who is dying. Do you understand?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes,” Nova grinned, she then knelt down and grabbed Dr. Nicholls hand.” Thank you, I appreciate this level of trust. It is always good to know your objective.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Your welcome Nova.” Dr. Nicholls squeezed her hand back. She then grabbed a wire from a cabinet and connected it to her tablet. “The memories are almost ready. This hasn’t been done before, I don’t know if they will be corrupted or if they will even be in the correct order. It’s all experimental.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I understand.” Nova smiled reassuringly and sat back up on the cart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Before I do this, I have to delete everything that isn’t your basic software, and you will no longer have the ability to go online.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Does that include this interaction?” Nova asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah it does.” Dr. Nicholls said. Nova looked hurt by that answer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “May I ask one more question?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Sure honey.” Dr. Nicholls said as she put down the tablet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What body am I in? It's not one of the basic models I’ve seen the blueprints to.” Nova’s curiosity once again took over.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s based on the person you are meant to become.” Dr. Nicholls looked down sadly. She pressed a button and suddenly the black glass on the wall of the room became clear. Behind it sat an older woman lying on a medical table. Tubes were attached to her arms and came out her mouth. A heart rate monitor detected a steady heartbeat. Nova got up and looked through the glass at the woman and realized that they had the same body.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Is that her?” Nova asked. “Is she the one I need to become?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    She then picked up her tablet and plugged the wire into the port on the back of Nova’s head. “Her name was Victoria Nicholls.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The doctor pressed a button on the tablet and Nova shut down preparing to remember the life of someone else.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Chapter 2 
                </h3>
                <p>
                    “Where is she?” A man’s voice echoed in the claustrophobic room. A television played the news in the background. It showed a map of the United States with red and blue states colored in and a banner on the bottom proclaiming, ‘Carlos Garcia president elect’ “Victoria? Are you listening to me? Where is your wife?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victoria was sat up straight looking into a mirror surrounded by lights as a young woman sprayed hairspray into her hair. She slicked back Victoria’s pixie cut until it looked stately. The dark black hair contrasted greatly with her pale white skin but made her green eyes starkly prominent. Another young woman put powder on her face. The wrinkles around her mouth and eyes revealed her age but gave her a dignified wise look.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think I’m good, ladies. Thank you.” She smiled as the two young women packed up their makeup and brushes and walked out of the room. Once the door was shut Victoria sighed and slumped over in her seat. Her forehead felt the cool texture of the wooden table as she rubbed the back of her neck with her hands. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “If I’m being honest Tom, I have no fucking idea where she is.” Victoria straightened out and looked at her campaign manager in the eye, though tired her eyes buried into his like emerald daggers. “It’s eleven o’ clock she’s probably at home sleeping if I were to guess.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victoria wondered if she or Charlie had watched the news during election night or if they had just gone about their day as normal. Victoria easily imagined her getting up like any other day and then she would drop Charlie off at preschool.  She would go to work and talked to talk to that guy in the parking lot that she couldn’t stand but still enjoyed her day because her job was truly all she had ever dreamed of. She would then come home to Charlie and cook dinner for the both of them and they would watch some of the shows that were on that night or possibly a movie. She would have put him in bed at 8:30 and then she would read her book until 9 or until she fell asleep, blissfully unaware of the world outside of her little bubble. Victoria wished she would come last minute, late as usual or at least be watching her from home but even that was a long shot. Victoria wondered what she would think. Was she proud? Scared?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The small recess of uncertainty and dread that had been there since the night before slowly flooded her body and mixed in with the current days overwhelming joy. The adrenaline had kicked in when winning became a reality right when Florida in all its unpredictability turned blue. It only grew as it was slowly revealed that they had won by a landslide. And then the crown jewel for the first time since 1976 Texas turned blue. These two contradicting feelings mingled with each other making her stomach do summersaults until they were fully blended and evenly distributed leaving her numb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well, that’s going to be a problem.” She could tell Tom was glaring at her. She knew he probably could tell something was wrong, that was a part of his job after all, but he probably didn’t know how bad the situation was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Why? She’s not the one giving a victory speech in thirty minutes.” Victoria stood up and walked towards him. Her royal blue suit was finely fitted to her thin body. She towered over him. She usually towered over everyone at a height of six foot plus the heels she was wearing. She liked heels even though she was already so tall it was one of the few feminine things she loved. She liked to loom over everyone, to be seen, to be listened to, to be respected. And as she looked down at Tom's balding head, she knew she was in control. He took a step back, so he didn’t have to look straight up when talking to her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yes, and if she’s not on stage next to you how will that look for this administration, when she isn’t there with you thanking donors what will that say about you. How about in eight years when you run for yourself?” His voice had less conviction than before but what he said still rang true. She respected him for that, he always gave it to her straight. He was a genius at his job. There was no doubt that her life would have been ten times more difficult without him at the table and she would desperately need him in eight years. She trusted him and for most things she did what he said without question but not this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Tom I am very thankful for the work you do. I know I would be making a very different address tonight if you weren’t a part of this campaign, but do me a favor stay out of my marriage. I’ll be addressing the nation in thirty minutes. That’s the priority. She has been told where she needs to go and when she needs to be there. If she is not here tonight that’s her choice and unfortunately, I have no control over that.”  In that moment he in his expensive grey suit and high position looked so small compared to her. He shrunk back away from her even more and no longer looked at her in the eye. It was for the best that she set her boundaries, but she did feel bad for lashing out at him. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victoria put her hand on his shoulder in a friendly way, “Hey, we won. You somehow convinced America to send a Mexican and lesbian to the white house. That’s on par with a miracle in my book. Tonight is supposed to be fun, let’s not stress over something we can’t control. If anyone from the media asks, we can make something up about how she got food poisoning or something.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tom looked into her eyes and he looked empathetic, “If things like this continue to happen this is going to be a problem.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I know. I will hopefully fix it after tonight if not then we will have a talk about what to do next.” With that Victoria walked out of the room with Tom two steps behind her. As she went down the hallway and looked through the open double doors into a huge plaza with many circular tables lined with well-dressed guests. A large podium was set up in the front of the room and several television cameras were being set up in front of it. She walked past this to another room, men in black suits stood on either side of the door outside. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Give us a few minutes Tom.” Victoria entered as Tom stayed back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The room was very similar to hers; it had a mirror table and a few chairs. Inside there was a man in a dark grey suit pacing back and forth he was wearing square gold rimmed glasses and looked down at a printed sheet of paper. He seemed like he was talking to himself every few seconds he would move his hand in some way or another whether to point or gesture to something. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You look presidential.” Victoria said. The man turned around and after a look of recognition they smiled at each other. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Almost,” The man winked at her, put the paper down and grabbed a bag off one of the chairs in the room. He pulled out a contact lens holder and took off his glasses. After putting in the contacts the man gave her a big toothy smile. His black hair was combed back and speckled with grey’s. His round belly gave him a fatherly like quality and contrasted with her thin profile. At this moment they were at about equal height.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ah, much better,” Victoria said as she crossed her arms and grinned back at him. He then spread his arms out and walked towards her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Carlos, no hugs. I think Tom might murder me if my hair or makeup get messed up.” She backed away from him, her arms still crossed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Come on, one hug won’t kill you.” He wrapped his arms around her. She was stiff and still hadn’t uncrossed her arms. After a few seconds she finally gave in and hugged him back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We did it.” Carlos said he laughed deeply and patted her twice on the back and then let her go, “We are meant to celebrate tonight. Drink champagne with me and my wife tonight after the address.” He raised his eyebrows and nodded to her as though she had already agreed to it. She straightened out her clothes making sure there were no wrinkles. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Of course,” Victoria nodded back. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I saw your mother wandering around the plaza. She was looking for you. Probably wanted to congratulate you about the win.” His warm voice seemed to fill the room. That was one of his best talents. He always knew how to make people feel whatever he wanted them to feel whether it was love, grief, or hunger for revolution. Hearing him speak was like going on a rollercoaster of emotions and it was always memorable above anything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “She seems like the pinch your cheek kiss every inch of your face type of person.” He laughed teasingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yup, that sounds like her,” Victoria rolled her eyes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Don’t be embarrassed. It’s a parent’s job to have pride for their children. If my mother were still alive, she would be the exact same way. I personally have embarrassed my daughter’s countless times. Let her have her fun without cameras or donors around. You have about thirty minutes before you go on.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thank you, President Garcia,” She over emphasized his title because it sounded so strange, almost like a fantasy. Like they were children playing a game pretending to be important people, but it wasn’t a fantasy they were the real thing. He smiled half in recognition of the abnormality half in pride. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You’re welcome Vice President Nicholls,” he winked once again and headed towards the door. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Do you remember where she was?” Victoria asked right as he got to the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, just stay in here I’ll find her again and send her in.” He walked out the door and left Victoria in the room waiting. She pulled out her phone and checked her messages. Most of them were exclusively congratulating her on the win, her mother had texted her ten minutes ago asking where she was but neither her wife nor her son had sent anything to her that night. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly there were three knocks on the door. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Come in,” Victoria braced herself in preparation for her mother. The door sung open and a grey-haired woman in her seventies hobbled her way into the room. She wore a light blue dress with a gray shawl and used a cane to support her left hip. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, sweetie I can’t believe it. I mean I knew you would always do something great, but this is just…” she walked up to Victoria and kissed her on the cheek. “I’m so proud of you and your father would be so proud if he were still here.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thanks’ mom,” Victoria wasn’t sure if she could really speak for her father. Politically they rarely saw eye to eye, but he valued hard work and ambition. So maybe he would have pride in her will to get here. His daughter might be a democrat but at least she’s a democrat who wins.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Where is Mai? I want her to sit with me during the address.” Her mother smiled and looked around as though Mai was hiding in the room somewhere. As if she were under a table or behind a curtain just waiting for her to arrive. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t think she is coming tonight.” Victoria strained her voice to make it sound nonchalant and normal though it was in vain because her mother knew something was wrong immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, why not?” Her mother’s face showed the worry that Victoria had expunged from her own. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Nothing it's just a stomach bug, things like this always happen at the most inconvenient time, don’t they?” Victoria smiled as though it was a joke hoping her mother wouldn’t question it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Please, don’t lie to me.” She grabbed her daughter's hand and looked into her eyes, “I’m your mother, I’ve seen you do this routine since you were five years old. I know when you aren’t happy especially when you try to hide it.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    They never had the best relationship in the world, but this was the first time she would be able to talk about it without fear of it affecting some other part of her life. Victoria was the only family she had left, and to some extent Victoria had no one else. For some reason she desperately wanted to tell her the truth. “Let’s just say this election has been hard on her and we are going to take a little time away from each other.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh god. Are you considering divorce?” She sat Victoria down and pulled up another chair to sit on. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We talked about it, but we didn’t decide on anything. Right now, I’m fairly certain she wants one, and I don’t blame her.” Victoria was surprised at how little she felt at this point. She expected anger, tears, or at least some sense of loss but no she talked about it like someone would talk about the weather. In her mind these were just facts, something that couldn’t be changed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What do you think mom?” Victoria said those words without even thinking about the consequences or implications. They just sort of leapt out of her and lingered heavy in the air for a few seconds as they both sat there in disbelief. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t think you've ever asked me that before.” Her mother chuckled before shedding a tear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah well, I guess I’m desperate right now.” Victoria gave a fake half smile which slowly faded when she met her mother’s eyes. “Please help me”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I think Mai and that beautiful boy are the two best decisions you ever made in your life. You are also the second most stubborn person I have ever known; your father is the only one that beats you in that department.” Both Victoria and her mother chuckled. “This might be hard to hear, but if you want to keep her, give her whatever she wants. God knows you get your way pretty much all the time but in order for something like this to work you just have to give her something. Make her feel important. Make her feel like she had some say in what happens.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    A knock came from outside the door and a woman yelled “Ten minutes Mrs. Nicholls”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thank you, Sarah,” Victoria yelled out the door. She got up and kissed her mother on the cheek. She looked in the mirror and smoothed out her hair and rubbed her mother’s lipstick off her cheek.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just talk to her. I’ll see you later tonight.” Her mom got out a handkerchief and fixed herself up and left the room.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victoria looked at her phone and quickly decided what she needed to do. She quickly went to her contacts and looked up Mai Nicholls and called it. The phone rang about six times then it went to voicemail. “Hi, you have reached Dr. Mai Nicholls. Sorry I can’t get to the phone right now but please leave a message. Make sure you leave your name and some way for me to contact you later. Leave your message after the beep.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beep
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey honey, It’s me. I really want to speak to you tonight. In case you don’t know yet we won. We will be officially announcing our victory in five minutes. I just thought I should tell you first. I really wish you were here not for how it looks in the media but because I want to celebrate my biggest accomplishment with the person I love the most. I didn’t like the way things ended last time we talked, and I just want to say you’re right about everything. I’m sorry about everything. You and Charlie are the most important in my life. I’ll do whatever I can to make you two happy. If that means getting out of all this craziness just say the word. I love you.” Victoria hung up her phone and set it back on the table.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another loud knock came from outside. “Mrs. Nicholls, it's time to head down.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Victoria looked herself over one more time in the mirror. It was hard to know if she actually looked good. She always asked Mai and she knew the answer she got back was always true.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She left her room and went back out into the hallway. Sarah escorted her into the wings of the stage. They had previously practiced every detail of the night to come. She knew everything from where she needed to stand to what she needed to say to what inflection she should use for each word. They even practiced lowering her voice a little bit, so she sounded more authoritative. The speech was instinct at this point and at the end she would introduce her future president and that was it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    She walked out onto the stage. An uproarious applause burst from the crowd of avid supporters and donors. She couldn’t help herself from smiling so hard it hurt. She waved to the crowd as subtly as the adrenaline in her veins would allow her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She finally made it to the podium. She looked over the crowd. She saw her mother sitting next to Carlos’s family. And then she performed it exactly as she had practiced. Every smile, every joke perfectly planned. She then called out President Garcia to uproarious applause. The honored man rushed out onstage smiling as big as he had waving the way he needed to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A loud bang suddenly rang throughout the entire auditorium; its echoes brought a sudden hush to the rowdy crowd. The world was still in that second as though everyone had just imagined it stopping only for a second to confirm it wasn’t real. Then chaos reigned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crowd screamed in horror. In Victoria’s sight they looked like cockroaches scattering the moment you turn the light on, hundreds of them trying to escape before being stepped on. She felt something warm flow down her chest. When she touched it with her hand, it felt wet. She looked down to see a black stream oozing down her shirt and seeping down her leg onto the floor. She was falling. The metallic taste of blood flooded her mouth. She pressed down on her chest where she thought the rest of her was spilling out from. She felt someone strong dragging her off the stage. As she looked back and could see the scarlet streaks that she left behind. She was now being carried and bounced around as someone ran with her. Slowly she felt her hand on her chest grow weaker and until she could no longer press on the hole in her chest and it went limp. A dark shadow seemed to fill up her vision until all she could see was black.
