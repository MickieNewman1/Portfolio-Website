                    Angel in the Moonlight
                </h2>
                
                <p>
                  Max drifted through her house in a drunken fugue state. The party her and her brother had thrown while their parents had been away for the weekend was starting to get out of hand. People who she had never seen before had crammed into the house like sardines. Despite her intoxication she was as smooth as a ninja swimming through the sea of people stopping her mom’s favorite vase from falling and moping up a spilled red solo cup  She had known this was a bad idea, but her brother was going away for college in a few weeks he might as well have a good send off. Plus, she knew if they got caught, he would get the brunt of the blame. 
              </p>
              <p>
                The party finally wound down as the clock hit 2am. Max poured herself another drink finally relieved that the night would soon be over. She went into the backyard to get some air; she was surprised that no one was out there. She sat on the lawn chair and looked up at the stars as the music pounded in the house behind her.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hey, do you mind if I join you?” The voice came from a girl standing in the doorway. She wore an oversized neon green hoodie over a pair of blue corduroy pants. Max had never seen her before. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah sure” Max said as she gestured to the chair on the other side of the table and she sat down.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I think the party is just about over. Parties are always so depressing when they die. What’s in that?” She points to the cup on the table.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s just rum and coke.” Max said smiling at the stranger.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you going to drink that?” She winked at Max. Her overgrown black hair hung in her dark brown eyes like she was in the middle of trying to grow out her bangs.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Probably not.” Max said thinking about the last round of shots she had before the party got out of control, “I’ve had too much already tonight.”
            </p>
            <p>
                With that the girl gave a thumbs up and took a drink from the cup. She then put it down and squinted at Max, “Wait are you like a disgusting diseased person?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Not that I know of.” Max said laughing. She was intrigued by the girl’s immediate comfort and intimacy with her. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ok cool” She laughed and took another drink from the cup. With most people this would have intimidated her or creeped her out. Maybe it was the booze or maybe it was the fact that in the moonlight this stranger looked like an angel, but she wasn’t scared. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “So, who invited you to the party? Do you know Daniel?” Max said wondering if they had both gone to the same school but just hadn’t seen each other before.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “The other person who lives here,” Max said
            </p>
            <p>
                “I kind of crashed. Don’t tell anyone, it can be our little secret.” She whispered to Max as she grinned. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Who did you come with?” Maybe Max could ask around about her later if they both knew the same people.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Funny story, I’m not sure.” She said with a look of mischief.
            </p>
            <p>
                “How can you not be sure?” Max wasn’t sure what to think of her now, “Wait you are in high school right?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh yeah I’m a Junior and I kind of got into this person’s car with a group of people and we all drove over here.” She sounded so nonchalant about the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Wait, so you got into a stranger’s car with a bunch of random people.” Max wasn’t sure if she was brave or stupid or a little bit of both.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It was more like a friend of a friend. It was exciting though.” She grinned like she knew Max was stunned by her, “It’s kind of fun going to people’s homes. I like to look around you can really get to know people by the way they live.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well that’s a little creepy.” Max said raising her eyebrows as she leaned in like the stranger was about to reveal a secret.
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m not like rummaging through the drawers or anything I just notice things as I walk through.” She smiled and laughed a little at the situation. 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh, ok That’s still a little creepy. What can you tell about the people who live here?” Max wondered what impression she had gotten from her house and room.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Well the parents are pretty boring everything is strait cut and basic like most of the rooms are strait out of a pottery barn magazine. But there are two kids living here or at least two bedrooms with stuff in them. I noticed that one of them is moving out there are a ton of boxes in their room. There was a Metallica poster on his wall, so I think he’s pretty cool. Maybe he’s like a Rockstar going on tour or something. He probably has one earing and carries a guitar around with him everywhere.” 
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh wow sherlock you really know your stuff.” Max smiled knowing her brother was probably playing wonder wall on his guitar at that very moment to try and impress some of the drunken stragglers who hadn’t left the party yet. “So, what about the other kid?”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Ok, his room was very clean, like almost neurotically clean. It had a lot of books. I don’t know why but I got some antisocial virgin nerd vibes. Like a future Unabomber type,” She grinned pleased at her joke.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh really, please elaborate.” Max nodded as she chuckled.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah, he’s probably like really fat and wears a fedora and likes to argue about literature. He probably has a neckbeard if he could even grow one at all.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Huh he sounds horrible.” Max tried to put on a serious face but couldn’t help but smile a little bit
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah just the worst kind of person.” She said trying to match the serious tone.
            </p>
            <p>
                After short silence Max said, “You know I live here and that’s my room.” Max saw the girl try to hold back her laughter. She covered her mouth and sort of snorted. This made Max laugh uncontrollably.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh my god. I’m so sorry.” The girl said. she grabbed Max’s hand as she tried to apologize.
            </p>
            <p>
                “No, its fine, I love being judged by strangers. It’s also nice to know what the future has in store for me,” Max was smiling so wide that it almost hurt. She rubbed her neck and said, “though I don’t think my neck beard is coming in anytime soon.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I should really go. You have been lovely and all I have done is broken into your house and insulted you.” She grabbed the cup and started to walk towards the side gate. Max started to get up as well hoping to walk her out and at least ask for her name. Right as she stepped off the patio the girl stiped and fell into the rocks, spilling the rest of the cup’s contents all over her neon hoodie.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Are you ok?” Max rushed over to her and helped her up.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Yeah I’m fine, just am clumsy and drunk.” She said obviously embarrassed about the tumble.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh my god you’re bleeding” Max exclaimed when she saw a small trickle of blood going down her arm.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh fuck. Yeah, I guess I am” She looked down at her arm in shock.
            </p> 
            <p>
                “I’ve got some bandages in my bathroom come up we can wash it out make sure it doesn’t get infected.” Max said she walked towards the door expecting her to follow but after a few steps she noticed that the girl hadn’t moved.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Hum maybe I shouldn’t follow strangers into their bathrooms.” She said sarcastically.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Didn’t you say you got into a stranger’s car earlier.” Max replied 
            </p>
            <p>
                “What’s your name?” she asked.
            </p>
            <p>
                “Max. It’s short for Maxine.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I’m Maylin.” She smiled sweetly and walked over to the door. “I guess this means we aren’t strangers anymore.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “I guess not. Come on in.” 
            </p>
