                <p>
                    The sun usually woke me up. Its warmth and light started at my feet and throughout the morning slowly ran up my body bathing me in light, cleansing me of the night before. It lulled me in and out of sleep, until eventually shining directly in my eyes and immediately slamming me back into my reality. Today was no different I woke up, cursed the sun for existing and myself for once again forgetting to close my blinds the night before. As my eyes adjusted, I watched the Arizona sun peak over the horizon, setting the sky ablaze with wisps of pastel pinks and reds. Its intensity grew eventually engulfing the neighborhood in the unrelenting summer rays. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    After watching the sunrise my mind had come alive. I stretched, peeling myself off the sheets. I made my way to the bathroom looking at myself in the mirror. My curly brown hair fought the brush as it parted the tangles. When that was done, I coaxed it into a ponytail to get it out of my face. I put on eyeliner and mascara to emphasize my big green eyes. I also put on lipstick on my thin lips trying to bring them out more. I slipped out of old t shirt and sweatpants and put on my typical black pants and red polo shirt. I pinned my name tag right above my right breast and looked at myself in the mirror. I felt self-conscious looking over my body, I was short and plane. I was not exactly fat, but the weight was distributed awkwardly over my body. My round face was ridden with freckles, they were significantly darker this time of year due to the summer sun. I thought of myself as overwhelmingly average.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went into the kitchen and started making scrambled eggs for breakfast. It was almost eight o’clock and only I had gotten up. I knew that dad had work in an hour. So, I walked over to the door of his bedroom and knocked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “DAD GET UP. BREAKFAST!” I shouted. I then stood in silence, pressing my ear against the door listening, hoping to hear the faint rustling of him waking. I was ultimately disappointed. He had come in from a night out with his friends and passed out. Waking him was going to be a difficult battle. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “COME ON, GET UP!” This time I pounded on the door and still nothing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok, you give me no choice.” I marched back to the kitchen and grabbed a plastic cup from the cupboard. I filled it with water and walked back to his door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I opened the door and entered the room. It was a mess, clothes all over the floor and dresser. The only things in the room that had any order were the two photos on the wall. One was of a group of men all dress in their military uniform the other was of him and my mother. The two photos were never crooked and there was never a speck of dust on the frames. I walked over to the bed and picked up the empty pack of cigarettes throwing them in the trash bin. I looked over at the snoring lump on the bed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey, come on, don’t make me do this.” I said as I shook him. He grunted and slowly tuned the other way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Ok.” I said, and I poured the water on his face. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    He shot up in shock and started coughing.  When he regained his breath, he looked over at me and yelled, “Why the fuck did you do that?!”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I have a sadistic sense of humor. Now get up and shower, you smell like shit.” I started to walk out of the room until I saw him lay down again. “Come on get up. I’ll do it again, I swear.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this he sat up again, finally accepting the start of the morning. “You know, you can really be a bitch sometimes.”, He shouted at me as I walked away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I blame you. Bitchiness is obviously genetic.” I said, he chuckled at that remark. I grabbed the plate of scrambled eggs and poured some salsa over them. “I made you breakfast but eat fast. You got work in an hour.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    He grabbed the plate and looked around. “Did you make any coffee?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No.” I told him. “We’re out of coffee… and milk and bread and as of this morning eggs.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’ll go to the store today, I promise.” He replied.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You said that yesterday.” I said calling him on his bluff. I loved my dad, but his promises didn’t mean much.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well, I’ll go to the store eventually. Speaking of things we need to do, what about the dishes?” he said staring at the large pile of dishes inside our insanely small sink. I had forgotten to do the dishes last night.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’ll do it when I get home.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Honk! A car horn sounded from out front. “Bye see you tonight” I said, shoving the last scoop of eggs into my mouth. I grabbed my work bag and hastily put on my shoes. I stumbled out the front door waving goodbye to dad. Out front there were two plastic lawn chairs and an overflowing trash can on a patchy lawn. I approached the red car at the end of our driveway passing dad’s baby blue Volkswagen beetle. I opened the passenger side door, set my bag on the floor and sat down.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey, sorry for getting out late. I hope we won’t be late” I said to Penelope, kissing her cheek as she started the car. She had been a lifelong friend to me. Even though she was two years older than me, we were inseparable all throughout school.  We met when I was ten. We both took the bus to school and had the same stop, so we would always walk home together. From then on, where she went, I followed. Her house was a ten-minute walk from mine, and I ate dinner there nearly every night. We started dating one year ago, because we were already so close no one really noticed a difference. It easy keeping it secret, though I wasn’t really the one at risk if people found out. Penelop’s mother was very catholic and the only person who we knew that would probably disown her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Dude we’re fine, no one will care if we are ten minutes late. What are they going to do, fire us?” She responded.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We pulled into the back parking lot of a white building. On the building was a large sign with the words El Pollo Loco on it, which translates to The Crazy Chicken. It was a Mexican fast food restaurant. Penelope had gotten me a job there last summer. I mainly washed dishes but this summer I had risen the ranks to clearing off tables and washing bathrooms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we drove in, we pulled up to a man in a white chicken costume flipping a sign. “Hey Miguel” I yelled out to him. He was Penelope’s cousin, who lived two houses down from her growing up. When we were young, Miguel constantly walked the line between friend and minor inconvenience. He later became the occasional third wheel to our dynamic duo, once cooties disappeared. He took off the chicken head and set down the sign. I rolled down the window as he walked up to the car and leaned against the door. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey, you guys are fucking late.” He smiled at us. “Get your ass in there.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No need to be rude. I just wanted to let you, know that you make a very sexy chicken.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I can’t imagine how many girls you’ve gotten, working this street corner.” Penelope added.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah, fuck you guys.” Miguel responded as he walked back to his sign. We started to drive when he yelled, “Hey Amy, I’ve got the money I owe you just come talk to me during break.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We parked and walked into the building. We walked and immediately got ambushed by Mrs. Garcia one of the cooks. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You guys are late. What do you two have to say for yourselves?” She said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We’re sorry.” I said. “It’s mainly my fault I got out late. Has Steve come in yet?” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve was our manager, he usually came in late on Tuesdays, so we weren’t worried about being a few minutes late on thoes days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Lucky for you two, he’s not here.” She said. “But don’t be late again, it’s not a good habit.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mrs. Garcia was older woman who had been working at the restaurant for years. She was very friendly most of the time, but always got angry at us if we slacked off. We opened for her as an apology for being late. Today Penelope was put in charge of the drive through. My shift was spent picking up plates, wiping off tables, and cleaning the occasional spill. I never minded this work it was simple and gave me time to think. I loved to engross myself in daydreams, living out fantastic stories in my mind as I walk like a zombie with a mop. At my first break I made my way to the back looking for Miguel. I had let him borrow fifty bucks a few weeks ago. I finally saw him as he was digging around in his bag. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thanks again for spotting me.” He told me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah sure. Any time man.” I said. “What did you need it for?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Just for rent, it’s a new place and I spent too much last month.” He said. “You and Penelope haven’t seen it yet. Have you?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, I thought you were still living at home.” I responded. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You guys should come over some time. We can hang out and play video games. My roommate is cool, like open minded and shit.” Miguel was probably the only person who knew me and Penelope were dating. He didn’t always say the right thing’s, with the occasional sex jokes and very personal questions, but his heart was in the right place. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah sure. We’ll have to do that sometime.” I said. “Well, I’ve got to get back. See you later.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I went back to work, devising a story in my head about an AI who slowly gains consciousness and emotions as I cleared the tables of the lunch crowd. At five when our shift ended, Penelope and I met up in the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “We should get some food. I’m hungry.” Penelope said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Agreed.” I answered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Girls there was a to go order that no one picked up. There are a few carnitas tacos if you two want to share.” Mrs. Garcia said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Free food is always appreciated.” She said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Thank you, Mrs. Garcia” I said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Um- hum.” She said as we made our way to the door.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We took the food and walked outside to a bench in front of the restaurant. We sat down and started tearing into our food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What are you going to do after high school?” I asked. She gave me an annoyed look this was probably the only question anyone ever asked her these days. “What? You only have a year left. You have at least thought about it by now.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I would like to say college, but I don’t think I’m smart enough for that.” She was smart enough to get in, she just wasn’t smart enough for full ride scholarships. Without that, the prospect of her going to anything but a local community college was about as likely as her going to Narnia. She wouldn’t ever agree to stay here once she was set free. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t know what will happen.” She continued, “I kind of just want to get out of here. You know? Travel the world New York, London, Tokyo, wherever. I at least want to experience a place that isn’t here. Don’t worry, I’ll take you with me. We can hop on a plane to the UK, live as beggars for a few months. We’ll seduce some price or princess, and then steal the royal jewels. We would be on the run forever, but be set for life.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Wow that’s such a well thought out full proof plan.” I said nodding in response “I would have gone for an all-out military coup, and just like taken over the entire government. Then everything you do is legal.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “So, how about you?” She asked me. “What’s your plan after you graduate?”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “It’s so far away, I haven’t really thought about it. I don’t know. I think I’m just going to stay close to home. I like this job and the people here, plus someone’s got to look after dad.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Dude, that’s why you need a change. You need to get away from your dad, I mean he’s not a bad person or anything. He’s just going to hold you back.” She said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He’s my family, I can’t just leave him behind all by himself. I mean, he raised me. I feel like I owe him something for that.” I answered I felt like we’ve had this conversation a thousand times since elementary school and our answers are always the same.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t fully agree with that, but ok. He’s family. But come on aren’t you ambitious? Don’t you want to do something more.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t know I don’t know what I want to do with my life, and I don’t want to be disappointed, when I eventually fail. I mean, I like things the way they are now. I can make a living and I’m around good people. why change things? But if you drag me to Europe for a week. I’ll come; I promise.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I will do it. I swear, I’ll stuff you into my suitcase if I have to.” And just like that our mini argument was over. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We laughed a bit and then let the conversation slip into silence. We had already reached the point where silences were easy because we no longer felt the need to impress each other. So, we sat there for eating our tacos in the parking lot of El Pollo Loco. It was the first pause in an almost nauseatingly hectic day. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey, I’m pretty tired. Can I take a rain check on hanging out and have you drop me off now?” I asked.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah, no problem.” Penelope grabbed her keys from her pocket, as I threw the taco bag away. We hopped in the car and drove off.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She parked her car at the end of the driveway. I saw from the car that all the shades were closed, and all the lights were on. It shined through the gaps and sides of the window giving the house a ghostly silhouette.  The door was wide open revealing the blinding light from inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Stop! There’s something wrong.” I said. Dad’s car wasn’t out front. “Something’s off.” I told her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hey, should I call the cops?” Penelope asked. She put her hand on mine in a comforting way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, it might just be that my dad is home early. I think I’ll just check it out myself, but stay out here in case anything happens.” I said. There was no reason to make a fuss if this was just a misunderstanding. My gut feeling told me something was off, but it wouldn’t be the first-time dad had come home and left the door and the lights on. Closing the blinds was a bit strange, but not completely out of the realm of possibility. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “This might not be a good idea” She said. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, it will be fine. Trust me.” I gave her a reassuring smile, though by the look she gave me I was sure she didn’t believe it. I stepped out of the car and started walking towards the door. Each step I took my mind kept making excuses about why things were left this way. I walked up the steps slowly, hyper aware of all the sounds around me. As I got close to the door, I peered around the corner. The first thing I saw was the gun on the counter. It was my dad’s army service pistole. It was only ever in the gun safe under his bed. Why would it be out unless something had happened? I snatched it quickly even though its very presence was alarming. Just having it in my hand calmed me a little. I took the safety off and ventured inside.

                    Every drawer and box had been ripped out of its place; all its contents thrown to the ground. The tower of dirty dishes had tumbled to the ground, covering the floor with ceramic fragments. Even the trash had been torn apart. I breathed a sigh of relief. It must have been a robbery. We have nothing of value, so they are probably gone by now.

                    I saw a large black duffle bag in the corner of the room and I didn’t recognize as mine or my dad’s. Being immediately suspicious of something so out of place, I slowly walked over to the bag and unzipped it. When I saw what was inside, I stopped breathing, maybe thinking that if breathed somehow the contents of the bag might change. Stacks of hundred dollar bills the size of bricks filled the bag to the brim. I zipped it up, unsure of what to think. As though to look for guidance I looked to my dads’ room. The door was cracked. I hadn’t checked his room yet, the bag and the money was so shocking I had almost completely forgotten to check it.

                    Gun in hand I approached the door. I stepped on dish fragments and other random things, which made a distinctive crunch beneath my feet. My hand shook as I reached for the doorknob. I swung the door open. An all too familiar figure hung on a rope from the ceiling. His body slumped over perfectly still and relaxed. His skin that looked as white and cracked as a porcelain doll. His lips were blue, and his eyes were bloodshot and grey. His face was distorted, but very clearly the face of my father. I turned and ran, unable to acknowledge what I had just seen. I grabbed the bag as I ran out.

                    When I got to the car, I tossed the bag into the back and got into the passenger’s seat.

                    “We’ve got to go. Drive!” I yelled.

                    “Ok. Ok.” Penelope started up the car and began to drive out of the neighborhood “What happened in there? Why you have a gun?”

                    I had completely forgotten that I had had the gun in my hand. “Just drive to Miguel’s place. I’ll explain when we’re there.” I didn’t even know what I would say. My understanding of what had happened played in my head like a dream. A grim, dark fantasy had blead into my reality, making me uncertain of what memories to trust. While my friend franticly questioned what had happened, I lay there in silence as the car drove into the night.
