                    I am currently attending CU Boulder and one of my majors is TAM, which is a major in the engeneering department that focuses on Technology, Arts, and Media. Within this major I work with a lot of programming languages and I do a lot of projects that I would like to show off here.

                    This game is a work in progress about a little girl who can interact with the real world and her dreams. In this game she when she changes things in her dreams to her surprise she sees that the real world changes with it . I was inspired by Alice  in wonderland both for the aesthetic of the game as well as some of the story lines.

                    A Tale of Procrastination
                </h3>
                <p>
                    This was made for my hypertext narrative project that I made for a Web design class. It is a choose your own adventure choice based game where the main charachter is procrastinating on her project and you have to help her through her day as she rushes doing the assignment. <b> CONTENT WARNING </b> This story explorers themes of depression, substance abuse, and nihilism.
