                    Hi I'm Mickie Newman (or McKenna Newman depending on how official I'm feeling), my pronouns are she/her/hers. I am an undergraduate at CU Boulder; and I am Engineering TAM and Film double major, with a minor in Creative writing. I am creating this Portfolio to show off the various projects that I have created during my academic career and a few things that I have worked on in my free time. My majors and minors are all over the place so I thought a website would be the best way to organize my various works in a better way.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal with this portfolio is to show off all the work that I have been apart of and to show off all the skills I have gained throughout my academic career.
                </p>
