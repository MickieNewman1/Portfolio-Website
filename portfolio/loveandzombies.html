                    I knew I was in trouble the first time I saw him. It was Halloween and he was the devil; I was a skeleton watching him from the side as he went on the dancefloor dancing like an absolute lunatic. His arms flailed wildly as he jumped up and down, I thought he was truly beautiful, not because of the dancing, his dancing was actually pretty bad, but because of his fearlessness. We made out that night in the basement. The night ended with an exchange of numbers and girlish giggles I had previously reserved for my middle school crushes. First it was coffee, then dinner and a movie, soon we were inseparable. Time passed by and then we were official and then we were in love. Happy weeks turned to happy months turned to happy years. I stayed at his apartment most nights of the week, it was closer to campus and I liked it there.

                    I turned to him one day, we were halfway through a conversation we had repeated a thousand times before, and his eyes had turned grey. At first, I thought nothing of it, “Just a trick of the light,” I thought. The next morning, I spotted the strands of white in his black hair. It was a slow shift, but by the end of the month he had gone full zombie. His lifeless gaze rarely met mine. My questions yielded grunts and one-word answers.

                    I tried so hard to get the old him back. We talked and partied and fucked. Sometimes when the vodka got to my head, I would see him as he was before, drunkenly dancing like a mad man, drunkenly dancing with me, but I would always wake up being held by something cold. I’d pry his stone like fingers off my body and cry about the defeat only to try again the next day. I tried until I was numb. I tried until one day I looked into the mirror and I was dead too. My hair had turned white and my grey cheeks were caving in, the skin had peeled away revealing the bone underneath.  I wanted to scream, run away and lock myself in my apartment until I had reclaimed the life I had lost, but even zombies get scared of being alone with their own thoughts. So, I tried to forget and I stayed the night. His white noise fed my white noise, and with him I entered my dreamless slumber. Time passed through us like wind, weeks blew by without any reaction. We were drenched in silence. Each day we would stare off at a movie, eat take out, and then go to bed without saying goodnight. Our words no longer had meaning, and so we resorted to grunts of acknowledgement, a mutual understanding that we were not alone. Little pieces of me would slowly fall off and get lost. At first it was a finger, then an ear, soon it was an entire leg. We would stitch back on the pieces we could find but I never was fully whole. I soon realized the bed was cold and empty even with two people in it and that scared me.

                    It took months for me to wake up and then another week to get brave enough to act. Three years of movie nights, fights, and inside jokes completely washed away by me in one winter evening. I stayed as strong as I could when I was with him. My cold monotone voice went through him like a blade slicing and twisting as the conversation unfolded. I saw him breathe again, the color came back to his eyes as they teared up in anguish and he spoke to me for the first time in months.

                    “Please don’t go,” he begged, as he was forced back to life by the knife I had just stabbed into his chest. I said what I needed to say and then shuffled out the door. I walked home half dead the cold winter landscape a blur in my periphery as the pain seeped in. My numbness was replaced by anger, happiness, confusion, denial, relief, and most of all pain. I was finally reborn again as I cried alone on the bathroom floor with my now beating heart, finally able to mourn a relationship that had dead for months.
