                    Mother's Love
                </h2>

                
                <p>
                    “Hey sweetheart, can you get your dad. I need him to get something for me.” Mom said as she wandered into the kitchen.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “He’s out ma. He went to seven eleven to get a coke” I told her as I ushered her back into the living room to her favorite purple suede chair. It was a lie, dad had been dead for five years, I thought it better to entertain her delusions instead of upsetting her. “What do you need? I can get it for you.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “No, I’ll just wait for him. He’ll only be a few minutes anyway.” She said. She grabbed the remote and flipped through the channels until she finally landed on the HGTV.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Really its no problem, just tell me what you want.” I said slightly impatiently. We did this dance whenever she had one of her episodes. She never tells me what she wants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I said I’ll wait. If you want to helpful, you can take some of those glasses to the sink. It’ll really help the clutter in this room.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I sighed and did as I was told. I knew that even if I was persistent, she wouldn’t talk to me. She wanted dad, so until she was lucid, I would have to wait. I hated when she was like this and I could never really tell if I was helping her or just making her worse. We never had a good relationship, so I sometimes thought I was a burden to her already deteriorating mind. She moved in right after dad died, I think that’s when we actually started to get along. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I picked out some of her vitamins and filled a cup with water. When I brought them to her she reached out and took them. That’s good sometimes it’s a struggle when she’s like this. A commercial with children playing on the playground started to play. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Its ashamed with such a big house that you don’t have any kids running around, you know it’s not too late. Either you or Naomi could still get pregnant.” She said 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m forty-two ma. I think it is a little too late.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well you can always adopt.” She said smiling. I can’t tell if she’s mad or jealous that I never had kids. I remember her telling me when I was sixteen the night after I wrecked my car that she never wanted me. That at some point her birth control fucked with her hormones so she stopped taking it and all of a sudden she was pregnant with me with escape. Though I never really forgave her for saying it I kind of understood her more after that fight. She was a bourgeoning artist just getting a start in life and then suddenly I was there, and she had to take off work, cook for me, clean the house. Her OCD probably didn’t help the situation, she still throws a fit whenever I leave a cabinet open or just leave an unwashed dish in the sink; I can’t imagine what a baby or a toddler would do to her. And then to have her only child grow up hating her all the time for random stupid things. I never had kids because I hated her so much for no reason and I knew I couldn’t handle it if my kids did that to me. She always asks me when I was going to have them. I don’t know if she wanted a do over, some grandkids that would actually love her or for me to finally understand what she went through so that maybe we could connect or so that she could have some sick revenge where I will finally see all my disfunctions through my kid. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “You want anything to eat?” I said desperately trying to change the subject. “I’m thinking of making a BLT.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Oh, that would be great, sweety.” she said her attention back on the television. Thank god she was easily distracted. I went back into the kitchen and fixed up lunch. After that we ate in silence. We never talked. We still don’t talk. It’s shocking how alone we both are in a room together. Even when we fought, we never talked. She would always be the one yelling whenever there was something wrong, and I always shut down whenever there was a problem just agreeing with her without actually meaning it. I was always afraid to contribute or open up about my life because I thought she would judge me. I mean she didn’t know I was gay until I literally had a fiancé. I had told my dad years ago and just assumed he passed on the message. The day I brought Naomi home I knew I was very mistaken; I had never seen her try to hide what she was feeling. That was something I really loved about her, she will always told you when she’s sad or angry, she wouldn’t always tell you why, but you always knew where you stood with her. That day she just kept on smiling as she helped us bring in our stuff, but as she asked if we needed anything, I could hear something was wrong in her voice. When I looked at her I knew I really hurt her, more than I ever had before, but at that point I didn’t know how to say sorry. Not to her at least, all my rationality and decency went out the window when it came to her.

                <p>
                    “Hey mom” I said ad I looked over at her. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Yeah” she said not shifting her attention away from the TV. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’m sorry.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “What for?” she asked turning to me looking concerned. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I don’t know I just thought I should say sorry. I love you. I hope you know that.” I said.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Of course I know that. I love you to sweety.” She reached out her hand and grabbed mine.
                </p>
